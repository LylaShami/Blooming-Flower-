            Both tampons and pads are one of the most popular period product out there. Some pros of pads are that they come
        in a lot of option and sizes. Compared to tampons, it gives you almost no risk of TTS (toxic shock sydrome). Another 
        pros to pads is that you can wear them overnight. However some cons to pads are that you cannot swim i them as they 
        get wet and cannot be used when in water. Also like tampons, pads are not usually environmental friendly unless they
        are the reusable ones. Pads are also more noticable than tampons but it also depends ont he size of your tampon. Pads 
        can also shift out of places and wrinkle up and may cause discomfort if that happens. If you want more information about the use of pads refer to 
        the link below or consult with a health professional:
