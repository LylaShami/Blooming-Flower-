            Tampons and pads are one of the most popular period product that is used today. Some pros to using tampons include
            being able to swim in them as they are inserted inside of you and therefoer water cannot affect it. They are also very discrete
            and you won't be able to feel them if they are inserted properly. On the other hand, some cons of tampons are that you 
            are more at risk for TTS (toxic shock syndrome), which is a rare but life threatening condition where bacteria gets into your
            body a releasing harmful toxins. If you want to learn more about TTS please refer to a health professional or visit the link below
            to find things you can do to prevent it while wearing tampons. Some other cons of tampons are that when youa re inserting them
            they may cause discomfort. Also finding the right size tampons might also take some time if you are new to tampons. They also
            sometimes irritate or dry your vagina which can cause you some discomfort. Tampons are also not environmental friendly. If you 
            want more information about the use of tampons refer to the link below or consult with a health professional:
